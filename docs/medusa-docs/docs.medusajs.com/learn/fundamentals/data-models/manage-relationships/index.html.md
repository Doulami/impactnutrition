# Manage Relationships

In this chapter, you'll learn how to manage relationships between data models when creating, updating, or retrieving records using the module's main service.

This chapter applies to data model relationships within the same module. To manage linked data models across modules, check out [Links](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/module-links) and [Query](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query).

## Manage One-to-One Relationship

### BelongsTo Side of One-to-One

When you create a record of a data model that belongs to another through a one-to-one relation, pass the ID of the other data model's record in the `{relation}_id` property, where `{relation}` is the name of the relation property.

For example, assuming you have the [User and Email data models from the previous chapter](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#one-to-one-relationship), set an email's user ID as follows:

```ts highlights={belongsHighlights}
// when creating an email
const email = await helloModuleService.createEmails({
  // other properties...
  user_id: "123",
})

// when updating an email
const email = await helloModuleService.updateEmails({
  id: "321",
  // other properties...
  user_id: "123",
})
```

In the example above, you pass the `user_id` property when creating or updating an email to specify the user it belongs to.

### HasOne Side

When you create a record of a data model that has one of another, pass the ID of the other data model's record in the relation property.

For example, assuming you have the [User and Email data models from the previous chapter](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#one-to-one-relationship), set a user's email ID as follows:

```ts highlights={hasOneHighlights}
// when creating a user
const user = await helloModuleService.createUsers({
  // other properties...
  email: "123",
})

// when updating a user
const user = await helloModuleService.updateUsers({
  id: "321",
  // other properties...
  email: "123",
})
```

In the example above, you pass the `email` property when creating or updating a user to specify the email it has.

## Manage One-to-Many Relationship

In a one-to-many relationship, you can only manage the associations from the `belongsTo` side.

When you create a record of the data model on the `belongsTo` side, pass the ID of the other data model's record in the `{relation}_id` property, where `{relation}` is the name of the relation property.

For example, assuming you have the [Product and Store data models from the previous chapter](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#one-to-many-relationship), set a product's store ID as follows:

```ts highlights={manyBelongsHighlights}
// when creating a product
const product = await helloModuleService.createProducts({
  // other properties...
  store_id: "123",
})

// when updating a product
const product = await helloModuleService.updateProducts({
  id: "321",
  // other properties...
  store_id: "123",
})
```

In the example above, you pass the `store_id` property when creating or updating a product to specify the store it belongs to.

## Manage Many-to-Many Relationship

If your many-to-many relation is represented with a [pivotEntity](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#many-to-many-with-custom-columns), refer to [this section](#manage-many-to-many-relationship-with-pivotentity) instead.

### Create Associations

When you create a record of a data model that has a many-to-many relationship to another data model, pass an array of IDs of the other data model's records in the relation property.

For example, assuming you have the [Order and Product data models from the previous chapter](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#many-to-many-relationship), set the association between products and orders as follows:

```ts highlights={manyHighlights}
// when creating a product
const product = await helloModuleService.createProducts({
  // other properties...
  orders: ["123", "321"],
})

// when creating an order
const order = await helloModuleService.createOrders({
  id: "321",
  // other properties...
  products: ["123", "321"],
})
```

In the example above, you pass the `orders` property when you create a product, and you pass the `products` property when you create an order.

### Update Associations

When you use the `update` methods generated by the service factory, you also pass an array of IDs as the relation property's value to add new associated records.

However, this removes any existing associations to records whose IDs aren't included in the array.

For example, assuming you have the [Order and Product data models from the previous chapter](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#many-to-many-relationship), you update the product's related orders as so:

```ts
const product = await helloModuleService.updateProducts({
  id: "123",
  // other properties...
  orders: ["321"],
})
```

If the product was associated with an order, and you don't include that order's ID in the `orders` array, the association between the product and order is removed.

So, to add a new association without removing existing ones, retrieve the product first to pass its associated orders when updating the product:

```ts highlights={updateAssociationHighlights}
const product = await helloModuleService.retrieveProduct(
  "123",
  {
    relations: ["orders"],
  }
)

const updatedProduct = await helloModuleService.updateProducts({
  id: product.id,
  // other properties...
  orders: [
    ...product.orders.map((order) => order.id),
    "321",
  ],
})
```

This keeps existing associations between the product and orders, and adds a new one.

## Manage Many-to-Many Relationship with pivotEntity

If your many-to-many relation is represented without a [pivotEntity](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#many-to-many-with-custom-columns), refer to [this section](#manage-many-to-many-relationship) instead.

If you have a many-to-many relation with a `pivotEntity` specified, make sure to pass the data model representing the pivot table to [MedusaService](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/modules/service-factory) that your module's service extends.

For example, assuming you have the [Order, Product, and OrderProduct models from the previous chapter](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#many-to-many-with-custom-columns), add `OrderProduct` to `MedusaService`'s object parameter:

```ts highlights={["4"]}
class BlogModuleService extends MedusaService({
  Order,
  Product,
  OrderProduct,
}) {}
```

This will generate Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) methods for the `OrderProduct` data model, which you can use to create relations between orders and products and manage the extra columns in the pivot table.

For example:

```ts
// create order-product association
const orderProduct = await blogModuleService.createOrderProducts({
  order_id: "123",
  product_id: "123",
  metadata: {
    test: true,
  },
})

// update order-product association
const orderProduct = await blogModuleService.updateOrderProducts({
  id: "123",
  metadata: {
    test: false,
  },
})

// delete order-product association
await blogModuleService.deleteOrderProducts("123")
```

Since the `OrderProduct` data model belongs to the `Order` and `Product` data models, you can set its order and product as explained in the [one-to-many relationship section](#manage-one-to-many-relationship) using `order_id` and `product_id`.

Refer to the [service factory reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/service-factory-reference) for a full list of generated methods and their usages.

***

## Retrieve Records of Relation

The `list`, `listAndCount`, and `retrieve` methods of a module's main service accept as a second parameter an object of options.

To retrieve the records associated with a data model's records through a relationship, pass in the second parameter object a `relations` property whose value is an array of relationship names.

For example, assuming you have the [Order and Product data models from the previous chapter](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/relationships#many-to-many-relationship), you retrieve a product's orders as follows:

```ts highlights={retrieveHighlights}
const product = await blogModuleService.retrieveProducts(
  "123",
  {
    relations: ["orders"],
  }
)
```

In the example above, the retrieved product has an `orders` property, whose value is an array of orders associated with the product.
